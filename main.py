PyDew Valley - Educational Game for Learning Python
==================================================
This is the main game file that starts and runs our farming simulation game.
Students will learn Python concepts through game development!

Educational Concepts Covered:
- Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
- Game loops and event handling
- Pygame library usage
- Module imports and organization
